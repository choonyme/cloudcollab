This program has been tested in Ubuntu Linux distribution.

==============
 DEPENDENCIES
==============
Please ensure the following dependencies are installed first:
- libjpeg-dev
- zlib1g-dev
- gtkmm2.4-dev
- libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev 
- libglademm-2.4-dev

=============
 COMPILATION
=============
To compile the package:
- Change to the directory where you have extracted the files.
- Run ./compile.sh

The binary files are located in:
- VNCProxy: vncproxy/src
- DrawTop: drawtop/src

To compile WhiteBoard, comment out #DEFINE OVERLAY from the
following files:
- drawtop/src/drawtop.cc
Then recompile WhiteBoard. The binary is then a WhiteBoard service.

=================
 TROUBLESHOOTING
=================
In case the installation procedure does not go as smoothly, this
is what compile.sh does:
- Compile LibVNCServer package. This is needed by VNCProxy and
  DrawTop.
- Compile VNCProxy.
- Compile DrawTop. 

Any compilation problem probably arises from NOT HAVING ALL
DEPENDENCIES REQUIREMENT by LibVNCServer. So focus on that!!!
Most packages in LibVNCServer (e.g. examples) are not needed.
All that is needed is:
- ./configure in LibVNCServer root directory.
- make in LibVNCServer-0.8.2/libvncserver (To get libvncserver.a)
- make in LibVNCServer-0.8.2/libvncclient (To get libvncclient.a)
